Notes : 1- My project didn't follow what I did on figma and on the sketching since I couldn't find any heart sensor and a good vibration motor. I wanted to use these 3 at start since I will need to use them for my innovation project, but I'll also need to use LED and a temperature censor might also be something to consider. So in the end it is still super usefull.
        2- Having multiple js code is kinda useless, I should have only one but since it started working like this and I had not much time left, since it was working perfectly fine,I didn't want to chnge everything to bug it.
        3- The same goes for the css I think 2 or 3 files were enough probably since between log in and home, they kinda have the same structure and the other 3 are also relative.
        4- It's also working pretty well for phone user even though I didn't @media in every css, the display flex have probably done the job right so that I don't have to put more lines of code.
        5- Thanks for this week, it was a really interessting topic and I might have to use a similar structure for my innovation project to collect data on a mobile app.
